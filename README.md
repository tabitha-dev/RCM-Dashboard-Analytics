## About The Project

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26cea6ff-3c2f-4eb8-ac04-9eac115f3ed4)


The **Healthcare RCM Analytics Platform** is a single-page web application mockup designed to showcase the core functionalities of a system that helps healthcare providers analyze and optimize their Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) performance. This project serves as a demonstration of front-end development skills using vanilla web technologies, simulating various interactions and data flows without a live backend.

It addresses critical aspects of RCM, including key performance indicator (KPI) tracking, trend analysis, patient account management, and reporting, all within a user-friendly and modern interface.

## Key Features & Simulated Functionality

This mockup provides a comprehensive simulated experience of a healthcare RCM analytics system:

* **üìä Dashboard Overview:**
    * **Holistic KPI Scorecards:** Displays key metrics like "Days in Accounts Receivable," "Net Collection Rate," "Denial Rate," and "Projected AR Days" with trend indicators (up/down arrows and percentage change).
    * **Interactive Trend Charts:** Visualizes "AR Trend Analysis," "Collections by Service," and "Denials by Reason" using HTML Canvas, with simulated dynamic data.
    * **Date Range Filtering:** Allows users to filter dashboard data by "Last 30 Days," "Last Quarter," "Year to Date," or "All Time."
    * **Threshold-Based Alerts:** Displays a prominent alert banner if "Days in AR" exceeds a customizable threshold.
    * **Drill-down Modals:** Clicking the "Denial Rate" KPI opens a modal with a simulated detailed breakdown of denials by payer, including a dedicated chart.
    * **Patient Accounts Table:** A dynamic table showing mock patient account details, with client-side search and pagination. A "View All Accounts" button scrolls to this section.

* **üìà Analytics Section:**
    * **Denial Analysis by Payer:** Features a dedicated chart visualizing denials across different payers, with a filter to highlight specific payers.
    * **Claim Submission Trends:** Displays a line chart showing simulated claim submission volumes over time.

* **üßæ Reports Section:**
    * **Report Parameters:** Allows users to select report type, data source, and output format via dropdowns.
    * **Calendar-Based Date Range:** Provides an interactive calendar for selecting custom date ranges for reports.
    * **Simulated Report Generation:** "Generate Report" button provides mock feedback.

* **üîß Settings Management:**
    * **User Profile:** View and edit simulated user profile details (Name, Email, Role).
    * **Notifications:** Manage notification preferences (email, in-app, weekly summaries).
    * **Alert Thresholds:** Customize the "Days in AR Alert Threshold" value.
    * **Data Sources:** Select primary and secondary data sources.

* **üì± Mobile Responsiveness:**
    * The layout adapts gracefully to various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop), ensuring usability across devices.
    * Tables intelligently collapse columns using container queries on narrower screens.

## Tech Stack

This project is built using fundamental web technologies, emphasizing a lightweight and client-side approach:

## How It Works

The application operates entirely within the browser, simulating complex functionalities using in-memory mock data and client-side JavaScript logic.

1.  **Initial Load:** The application loads directly to the Dashboard.
2.  **Data Simulation:** All data (KPIs, patient accounts, chart data) is stored in JavaScript arrays and objects within the browser's memory. There is no persistent backend database.
3.  **Dynamic Rendering:** JavaScript manipulates the DOM (Document Object Model) to dynamically update content, filter lists, and display simulated results based on user interactions.
4.  **Simulated Actions:** Buttons and form interactions trigger JavaScript functions that update in-memory data, display alerts, or render new chart visualizations, giving the impression of complex operations.
5.  **Navigation:** Section switching (Dashboard, Analytics, Reports, Settings) is handled by toggling the `display` CSS property of different content sections.

## üèÅ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/tabitha-dev/RCM-Dashboard-Analytics.git](https://github.com/tabitha-dev/RCM-Dashboard-Analytics.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd RCM-Dashboard-Analytics
    ```
3.  **Open `index.html` in your browser:**
    You can simply double-click the `index.html` file or use a local server extension (like Live Server for VS Code) for convenience.

## Future Enhancements Ideas

To evolve this mockup into a more feature-rich and robust application, consider these enhancements:

* **Persistent Data Storage:** Integrate a lightweight client-side database (e.g., IndexedDB) or, for a more advanced version, a cloud-based NoSQL database (like Firebase Firestore) to persist user data across sessions.
* **Advanced Charting Library:** Replace custom canvas drawing with a professional JavaScript charting library (e.g., Chart.js, D3.js) for more complex visualizations and built-in interactivity.
* **Enhanced Drill-down:** Implement multi-level drill-down capabilities where clicking a chart segment filters related tables and other charts, providing deeper root-cause analysis.
* **Predictive Analytics Integration:** Integrate a simple machine learning model (even client-side, using libraries like TensorFlow.js) to generate more sophisticated future forecasts for KPIs.
* **Accessibility Audit:** Conduct a thorough accessibility audit to ensure the application is usable by individuals with disabilities, adding ARIA attributes and improving keyboard navigation.
* **User Authentication & Roles:** Implement a more robust mock authentication system with different user roles having truly distinct views and permissions.
* **Customizable Dashboards:** Allow users to rearrange, resize, and select which KPI cards and charts are visible on their dashboard.
